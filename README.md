In the current state of the project there is simple water physics on the players boat. simple player controls such as walking, jumping, cayote time and 'digging'. Islands are procedurally generated and textured. Each island generates multiple meshes at different lods allowing for 
simpler renders at long distances. All of the assets spawned on the islands also have LOD meshes. Each island also comes with a map with a red 'X' to show the player where the treasure is hidden. The red dot on the map lines up with where the 'dig spot' is on the island
I started working on enemy spiders, i decided i wanted a procedural walking animation. That then is what started the procedural walking animimation RT project. I havent been back at this project for a while, however, my next step will be to add ship steering controls 
and fighting mechanics with swords and guns.
